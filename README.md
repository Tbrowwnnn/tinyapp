# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

The final product is a tinyURL clone that will take full length URLs and replace them with a tiny ID. This tiny ID will redirect users to the full length URL in order to save space since a micro-status typically has a character limit. Functionality includes profile logging in, encrypted passwords, logging out, filtered URLs, and restricted edit access based on profile.
